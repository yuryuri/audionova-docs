# Creating and Mixing a Track

This guide walks you through how to use AudioNova to upload a track, start a session, and create a mix using the AI assistant.

## 🎵 Step 1: Add a Track

Inside a project, click **"Add Track"** and fill in the form:

- 🎵 **Title** – name of your track
- 📝 **Description** (optional)
- 🎤 **Instrument** (e.g. Vocals, Drums)
- 🎧 **Genre** (e.g. Latin, Techno)
- 💖 **Mood** (e.g. Romantic, Energetic)
- 🎙 **Recording Method** (e.g. Studio Recording)
- 🔗 **Audio File** – upload your `.wav` or `.mp3`

> 💡 You can also add notes to describe what the stem does (e.g. “female backing vocals with reverb”).

## 🧠 Step 2: Start a New Session

In the **left sidebar**, click **"New Session"**.

- A default session is created for every project
- You can rename and manage sessions
- Completed mixes are tracked (limit applies on Free Plan)

## 🗣 Step 3: Talk to the Mixer

Now the fun part — in the **Mix Panel**, you can send messages like:

> `Punchy synth bass with tight compression, controlled low end, and no reverb`

The AI processes the prompt and mixes your track accordingly. You’ll see:

- 💬 Your prompt history
- 🔊 A waveform visualizer
- ❗️Status messages (if there's an error)

Click **Play** to preview the result.

## 🔁 Step 4: Iterate & Refine

Want to adjust the mix? Just keep typing:

- `Make the vocals warmer`
- `Add slight delay to the snare`
- `Now increase overall loudness`

Each prompt updates the mix contextually.

## 💡 Tips

- Use specific audio terms (see: [Prompt Tips](./ai-prompt-tips.md))
- Shorter prompts are better
- Mixes can fail if audio is corrupted or overly complex — re-upload and retry
