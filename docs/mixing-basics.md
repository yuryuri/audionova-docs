# Mixing Basics: Understanding the Fundamentals

New to mixing? Here's a crash course to help you understand what AudioNova's AI is doing under the hood — and how your prompts shape the sound.

## 🎚 What is Mixing?

Mixing is the process of balancing, shaping, and enhancing the individual elements of a track so they work together as one.

Think of it as turning a **raw recipe of sounds** into a **finished meal**.

## 🧰 Common Tools in a Mix

Here are the essential ingredients of any mix — all of which can be activated through your natural language prompts in AudioNova:

### 🎚 EQ (Equalization)
Changes the **frequency balance**. You can:
- Boost brightness → `Add air to the vocals`
- Cut muddiness → `Clean up low mids`
- Sculpt tone → `Tighten the low end`

### 🧵 Compression
Controls **dynamic range** — makes loud parts quieter and quiet parts louder:
- `Make the drums punchier`
- `Smooth the vocal performance`
- `Glue the mix together`

### 🌫 Reverb
Simulates **space and depth**:
- `Put the vocal in a big hall`
- `Add subtle room reverb`
- `Make the snare feel distant`

### ⏱ Delay
Repeats sounds over time. You can specify:
- `Slap delay on the vocal`
- `1/8 note echo with feedback`
- `Stereo ping-pong delay`

### 📐 Stereo Width
Controls left/right spread:
- `Widen the synths`
- `Narrow the bass`
- `Spread the background vocals`

### 🔊 Saturation & Distortion
Adds **character, edge, or warmth**:
- `Add analog tape saturation`
- `Make the guitars gritty`
- `Warm up the master bus`

## 🧠 Why Prompts Matter

When you say:
> `Make the drums tighter with a punchy low end`

You're implicitly asking for:
- Compression with fast attack
- EQ boost around 60–100Hz
- Possibly transient shaping

You’re not tweaking parameters — you're **expressing outcomes**, and AudioNova handles the rest.

## 💡 Mixing vs Mastering

- **Mixing**: balancing and designing individual tracks
- **Mastering**: polishing the entire mix for final release (loudness, stereo balance, final EQ)

AudioNova focuses on **mixing**, but some mastering-like effects can be simulated too.
