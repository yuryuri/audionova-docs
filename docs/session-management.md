# Managing Projects & Sessions

AudioNova organizes your work into **projects** and **sessions**, giving you a flexible way to manage multiple versions of your mix and collaborate with others.

## 📁 What’s a Project?

A **project** holds all the stems and audio files for a specific track or production. Within each project, you can:

- Upload and label tracks (vocals, drums, etc.)
- Add notes and metadata (genre, mood, etc.)
- Track your session history

Each project is like a folder for one song or idea.

## 🧠 What’s a Session?

A **session** is where you interact with the AI to mix your track.

- You can have **multiple sessions** in a project
- Sessions save your prompts, AI responses, and mix history
- Think of it like “save points” for different creative directions

## ➕ Creating a New Session

1. Go to your project’s left sidebar
2. Click **“New Session”**
3. Name it something meaningful (e.g., `Wide Mix v2`, `Club Master`, `AI Test`)

> 📝 You can rename sessions later by clicking the edit icon ✏️

---

## 🗑 Deleting a Session

1. Select the session you want to remove
2. Click the 🗑 icon next to its name
3. Confirm the deletion — this cannot be undone

> ⚠️ Deleting a session removes all associated AI prompt history and mix previews.

## 📌 Tips for Organizing Sessions

- Use sessions to explore alternate mixes or arrangements
- Create a new session before major changes so you can A/B compare
- Add your own notes for context like:
  - “This version is warmer and has more vocal presence”
  - “Club mix — boosted low end, wide synths”

---

## 🔄 Session Limits

- **Free Plan**: Up to 5 sessions per project
- **Pro Plan**: Unlimited sessions (coming soon)

Stay organized, experiment freely, and don’t be afraid to keep backups!
