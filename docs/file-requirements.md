# File Upload & Audio Requirements

Before mixing with AudioNova, here’s what you need to know about uploading tracks, supported formats, and best practices for clean results.

---

## 🎵 Supported File Formats

AudioNova currently accepts:

- `.wav` (preferred for quality)
- `.mp3` (accepted, but may have artifacts)
- `.aiff` (limited support — use `.wav` if possible)

> ❗️32-bit float `.wav` is not yet supported — export as 24-bit PCM instead.

---

## ⬆️ Upload Limits

- ✅ Max file size: **100MB**
- ✅ Max number of tracks per project (Free Plan): **5**
- ✅ Max simultaneous sessions: **5**

For larger multitrack sessions, you may want to **group stems** (e.g., bounce background vocals together).

## 🎚 Best Practices for Uploads

For optimal AI mixing:

### ✔ Clean Your Files
- No clipping
- Remove unwanted noise, silence, or pops
- Trim to actual content (unless fade-ins/outs are needed)

### ✔ Leave Headroom
- Export your stems **around -6 dB to -3 dB**
- This gives the AI headroom to process your tracks safely

### ✔ Avoid Heavy Pre-Processing
- Don’t add limiting, stereo widening, or FX on your raw stems — the AI will handle it better from a clean starting point

---

## 📌 Tips

- Label your tracks clearly (e.g., `LeadVox.wav`, `Kick.wav`)
- Add metadata (mood, genre, etc.) when uploading for better AI context
- Shorter clips may process faster — trim to the needed sections
