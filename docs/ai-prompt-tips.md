# Tips for Writing AI Mixing Prompts

AudioNova's AI mixer responds to **natural language prompts** to shape your sound. The better your prompt, the better your mix.

---

## 🧠 How Prompts Work

You type mixing instructions like:

Warm analog sound with soft reverb and tight low end:


The AI interprets and applies processing based on cues like:
- 🎚️ EQ
- 🧵 Compression
- 🌫 Reverb / Delay
- 🎛 Stereo width
- 🎧 Genre & vibe

---

## ✅ Good Prompt Examples

| Prompt | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| `Clean pop vocal with light reverb and subtle compression` | Polished vocal chain |
| `Deep house kick with boosted low mids, no reverb` | Focused kick tone |
| `Lo-fi guitar with tape saturation and mono width` | Vintage texture |
| `Bright EDM drop with sidechained bass` | Modern loudness & movement |

---

## ❌ Common Mistakes

- **Too vague**  
  `Make it better` → instead try:  
  `More aggressive drums and wider stereo image`

- **Too long**  
  Break it up!  
  ❌ `I want soft vocals with airy highs, low mids cut, and stereo enhancement with no reverb`  
  ✅  
  - `Soften vocals and boost highs`  
  - `Cut low mids`  
  - `Widen the stereo`

- **Only genre**  
  `Make it techno` is okay, but better:  
  `Punchy kick with dark atmosphere and minimal reverb`

---

## ✍️ Prompt Formula

Use this structure:

> [Tone or Genre] + [Processing] + [Optional Reference]

Examples:
- `Warm acoustic mix like Bon Iver`
- `Trap vocal with autotune and slap delay`
- `Ambient pads with shimmer reverb and slow attack`

---

## 💡 Bonus Tips

- Iterate:  
  → `Add brightness to vocals`  
  → `Now compress slightly`

- Use **musical** or **emotional** language:
  - `Dreamy`
  - `Harsh and crunchy`
  - `Club-ready`

- Think like a producer, not an engineer. Speak to the AI like it’s a collaborator. 🎛🧠

The more musical your language, the more musical your mix.

## 🧠 How to Speak to the AI — Prompt Grammar for AudioNova

AudioNova is powered by a **language model**, not a traditional knob-based plugin — so how you phrase your request matters.

Here are some special syntax tricks and prompt structures that can help guide the AI more precisely:

---

### 1. **Use Clear Signal Words**

Instead of vague ideas like "make it cool," use effect-oriented words:

- ✅ `brighten the vocals` → triggers EQ boost in high frequencies  
- ✅ `tighten the kick` → invokes transient shaping or compression  
- ✅ `add atmosphere` → usually means reverb or stereo widening  

---

### 2. **Use Brackets for Instructions**

You can include **extra context inside square brackets** that helps the AI understand your intent, without it being processed as literal text:

> `Give the drums a gritty texture [like old vinyl or cassette]`

> `Add shimmer reverb to the synth [emulate Valhalla-style tone]`

This helps the AI narrow the stylistic reference or aesthetic.

---

### 3. **Use Parentheses for Variations or Emphasis**

You can use `()` to *repeat* or *emphasize* traits or layers in your mix:

> `Add deep, booming low end (sub-heavy)`

> `Delay the vocals slightly (1/4 note) for movement`

The model sometimes interprets these as *secondary weighting* — especially useful when layering.

---

### 4. **Chaining with Arrows →**

You can guide sequences step by step:

> `Compress the vocals → brighten the top end → add slap delay`

This helps the AI follow a logical mixing order.

---

### 5. **Role-Based Prompting**

Try speaking to the AI like you're instructing a real engineer:

> `You're the mastering engineer. Make this sound polished and commercial-ready.`

Or:

> `Mix this as if it were for an ambient film score.`

Framing the role helps condition the AI toward your goal.

---

### 6. **Comparisons Work!**

> `Make the drums hit like Travis Scott production`

> `Vocal tone similar to Billie Eilish — intimate and breathy`

Names, styles, or analogies are often well-understood by the model.

## 💡 Final Thought

You're not turning knobs — you're speaking in ideas. The clearer your **intention**, the better the AI will translate it into sound.

This is **not just prompting** — it's the new language of mixing. 🧠🎚✨
